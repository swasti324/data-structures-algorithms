**Kotlin Tour**

What features do you like about Kotlin? Are there things you were expecting to find 
that you havenâ€™t? What questions do you have?

1. I like how efficient Kotlin is. The when function and do-while functions were 
really intuitive. Lambda notation is additionally very concise. 
2. I haven't touched java in a long time so my expectations for learning the syntax 
was very limited. Since it all felt new, I wasn't exactly surprised by any additions/features.
I did find it frustrating to switch my python syntax to kotlin at first but my experience 
with Typescript helped me eliminate basic type errors. 
3. No specific questions now. I think my biggest challenge was navigating IntelliJ and Gradle.
The process for creating unit tests was ultimately easy but took a long time to find an answer 
of how to do it.
